# 1000 - T minus 2 hours

So the day of the exam has finally arrived. The day before, the study room has been cleared out, my laptop and oversized monitor parked on the newly bought IKEA table. 

Hopefully it stays on for the next 24 hours. Pretty sure I had screwed everything in, but I had a few pieces leftover. Let's hope for no disaster

Time for some light brunch. Nobody should go hungry into an exam. Not especially a 24 hour one

Did a quick test with speed test. Nice, 600 Mbps upload and download. Discord closed, whatsapp closed. 

Vs code up and running. Copilot disabled

Burpsuite running, bloodhound running, 

12 terminals running, ready for commands

Air purifier running, because, haze

# 1145-1215 - Proctoring setup

Time to log in and set up the proctoring. 

Read the instructions many times over, but still ignored that line that says the proctoring prefers Chrome for any setup with multiple monitors. 

Started with Firefox and the proctors couldn't see anything more than the first monitor. Oops my bad. Restart with Chrome. With my stubby fingers, somehow i still managed to choose to setup screen sharing to the same monitor. 

Is this a precursor of things to come? I shook my head at my technical incompetence. Maybe geniuses are good at one thing only and suck at others. I decided to ignore what was this one thing I'm supposedly good at.

Showed the proctor around my room. I would have introduced all the labubu's hanging on the wall but I forget their names. Many old IT books on the shelves to give me the look of an intellectual. As they say first impressions count. Don't think I ever read even half the books

Ran some scripts on their command. Guess they were looking to see if I was running some auto-aim or team viewer. If my finger typing and clicking doesn't match the screen, just blame it on the lag

Just before the end, i get a message that says no headphones allowed. Another oops. I theatrically took off my headphones like the good student I am and placed it in the corner.  Hopefully the proctor has a good impression. Wonder if they give extra marks for looking like a good student

# 1215 - 1230 - Exam officially starts

We're galloping off into the ~~new year~~ environment. 

Looked at the email. Start the vpn with this vpn package that was customized just for me? I feel touched

Where was this exam control panel I'm supposed to go to? Cpanel? What an imaginative subfolder name for a site hosting control panel. Wonder if I get extra marks for enumerating this site.

Once I opened it up, I can hear my laptop fan running at full speed. So noisy, I wish I had my headphones

# 1230 - 1300 - Gentlemen, start your engines

Took a while to set up all the templates and scripts. Should be a piece of cake from this point onwards. 

Lets go!

# 1230 - 1430 - Circles

So the galloping horses ground to a halt. Wondering what's the issue here. Pretty sure I did everything correctly. Or did I? 

My standard processes failed. Not sure I like doing things differently on the fly. This isn't how it's supposed to be! 

Starting to seriously doubt myself

Maybe I'm running in circles. I better do something

# 1430 -1500 - International Man of Mystery

Oops. While I was furiously clicking again, I somehow disconnected my screen share. Maybe it wasn't me!

Had to log in again and apologize to the proctor, and reshared the screens one by one. Hope I didn't mess that up again

Now the VPN is restarting for some reason. Lost my RDP connection too. Gave up after a while and re-ran the VPN

Still not working, the VPN keeps restarting, so decided to complain to the proctor

He said "Please try again."

Oh it's no longer restarting. I think the proctor must have stared really hard at the VPN and told it to behave

Wonder why it didn't work when I did the same

# 1500 - 1530 -  Danger Zone (10 marks)

Got it. So I was right. Or maybe not, I'm not sure but I'm not going to complain after taking such a long time to get my first flag. 

Wonder if I'm doing well. Perhaps others would have completed their AD by now. 

Totally out of my comfort zone

Not being able to log all your steps is annoying and terrifying!

Time for a break. I left my water bottle outside. Feeling a little thirsty from all this concentrating

# 1545 - 1715 - 99 Problems (20 marks)

Looking good but still took a lot longer than I expected. 

Winpeas whispered into my ear. Look here. I ignored him. 

Turns out he was right and I'm wrong

Maybe it's nerves, or maybe I'm not that good at this. Or too old. Or all 3.

Well, not going to beat myself up for this. He did whisper 99 other things that were *wrong*

# 1730 - 1800 - Livin' on a prayer (40 marks)

Finally submitted the final hash for the AD. 

Took a little longer than I expected. Not sure if this is good or bad timing. Well anyway time to take a another break. 

We're halfway there

Time for a break

# 1815 - 1830 - $RANDOM

Feeling somewhat inspired, decided to randomly pick a box to enumerate

# 1830 - 1930 - Stand alone complex (60 marks)

Accidentally stumbled upon the foothold. 

Ho ho ho. I'm laughing both in the inside and outside. I hope the proctor doesn't mind this embarrassing display

Today must be my lucky day. Think I'm supposed to deposit money at this hour or something. Stuck here so I can't do it. I hope the god of fortune accepts thoughts and prayers

Privesc was easy as pie. Sudden craving for pie. 

I wonder what is for dinner. 

# 1930 - 2030 - American Pie

Not sure what is going on now. No luck with the remaining two boxes. Where's the foothold. Can't even smell it. Did I not enumerate correctly? 

Whatever just brute force everything like the fool I am

Now I'm hungry thinking of pie again. What happened to easy? I give up. Time for a break.

# 2030 - 2100 - Silent Hill

Who am I?

No dinner yet. Losing energy and my mind.

I start questioning my life choices as I sat in my uncomfortable chair. I looked at my 4 phones. Nobody is saying anything. 

Decided to rawdog the rest of my time staring at the wall

# 2100 - 2130 - Doom

Going back in to continue my hopeless situation. Looked through all the logs I obtained. Am I the problem?  Did I enumerate correctly? Vaguely recall my days playing in secondary school. I wish I had the BFG

Re-ran some enumeration, but insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. I guess I must be insane. 

I hear dinner is outside but I just got back in. Let me pretend to concentrate in front of the camera for a while

# 2130 - 2200 - Gone phishing

Dinner is salmon fillet with rice. And green tea. Delicious. And oily. And messy. 

Talking really loudly here and laughing at bad jokes. Wonder if the proctor can hear us. 

I hope they don't feel jealous that I'm having a party while they have to stare endlessly and wordlessly at an empty chair

# 2200 - 0000 - Alone in the dark (80 marks)

Went back in again. Decided on a fresh approach. Looks like I'm not insane after all

Randomly trying out weird things. Oh weird. That worked? Now I feel dumb

I suppose every story has got to have some Deux ex machina. Nobody likes a tragic story

Privesc looks annoying, but straightfoward. I guess this was the supposedly easy box. 

Easy is hard. Well whatever, time to go outside and toot my own horn

# 0000 - 0100 - Devil May Cry

The other half is already asleep. Feeling deflated, I decided to take a shower and do some dishes. Oil is annoying to remove. 

Wonder if the proctor will think I'm a different person with my change of clothes. 

Maybe that's my evil twin working hard at the problem while I sleep blissfully, dreaming of a better tomorrow

I hope I don't have to kill my twin

Time to drink more green tea and go back in. Love the Green Mediterranean diet

# 0100 - 0500 - Home alone

Annoyed. So, so annoyed. Just give up and let me in already. Why aren't you giving up? I don't think Joe Pesci had this much trouble. Ok, at least the box isn't spitting fire at my head

I think I must have lost my mind a few times. The proctor must have been confused by this person who is clicking furiously and refreshing the tabs over and over again. 

Pretty sure that was just the green tea kicking in. 

# 0500 - 0600 - Grand Theft Auto (100 marks)

Finally found you, you sneaky little foothold. See, we can all be friends. 

This must be the supposedly hard stand-alone machine. Well I have to give it to them, it was indeed hard

And of course once you let the thief in, expect them to loot you of everything. Poor box, he had to give up his proof of existence. 

Too bad I lack empathy. I don't feel bad at all. Time to go celebrate again. I can see daylight peaking into the room

# 0700 - 0830 - Ippo

Oops. Think I might have celebrated prematurely. I have to look through my notes and make sure I have all the steps. 

Pretty sure I wasn't very detailed in my steps.

Looks like I need to go through them step by step again

# 0830 - 0900 - Back to the future

Unsatisfied with the privesc of the intermediate box. 

Going to do be a good student and do it the way they intended me to do it, the supposedly right answer. 

Looks like I need to redo my notes and my screenshots for this section

People might look at me thinking I am crazy. Yup definitely crazy for changing my answer mid exam. I suppose I do sort of look like Doc

# 0900 - 0930 - Never Ending Story

Look through my notes going through all the machines. Over and again. Repeat ad nauseam.  

Starting to lose consciousness. What was I doing again? Did i get all my screenshots? 

Maybe. Not sure. Maybe I should do it again. No, it's time for a break

# 1000 - 1005 - Heroes

You know what. Forget it. Tired and done

Told my proctor I would like to end the exam

I wonder if they are impressed. They asked me to do a survey before the proctoring ends. 

No problems, gave you 5 stars, I hope you give me 5 stars too

I'm going to be a hero just for today. Time to sleep!
